1
00:00:00,922 --> 00:00:03,281
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:03,928 --> 00:00:05,895
After five years
on a hellish island,

3
00:00:05,897 --> 00:00:08,764
I have come home
with only one goal--

4
00:00:08,766 --> 00:00:11,217
to save my city.

5
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:15,404
But to do so, I can't be
the killer I once was.

6
00:00:15,406 --> 00:00:19,742
To honor my friend's memory,
I must be someone else.

7
00:00:19,744 --> 00:00:24,580
I must be
something else.

8
00:00:24,582 --> 00:00:26,749
Previously on "Arrow"...

9
00:00:28,336 --> 00:00:30,119
Ivo killed Shado.

10
00:00:30,121 --> 00:00:31,587
Because I chose to save you.

11
00:00:31,589 --> 00:00:34,540
The man who killed Shado
is still out there.

12
00:00:34,542 --> 00:00:37,176
Not for long. Because we're going
to take the freighter.

13
00:00:37,178 --> 00:00:38,694
Merlyn is
Thea's father.

14
00:00:38,696 --> 00:00:40,763
But I thought you deserved
to tell Oliver yourself.

15
00:00:40,765 --> 00:00:43,582
I'm not going
to tell my son anything.

16
00:00:43,584 --> 00:00:46,853
Thea can never
find out about Merlyn.

17
00:00:46,855 --> 00:00:48,888
As of right now,
we have no relationship.

18
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:50,879
You and I are done.

19
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,101
Sweetheart, you ok?

20
00:00:52,821 --> 00:00:54,771
Every single thing
that's gone wrong

21
00:00:54,773 --> 00:00:57,557
in our lives is your fault.
Now get out.

22
00:00:57,559 --> 00:00:59,926
I'm sorry.
I said, get out!

23
00:01:10,988 --> 00:01:12,205
In six seconds,

24
00:01:12,207 --> 00:01:13,523
lobby security will

25
00:01:13,525 --> 00:01:15,825
undergo a shift change.

26
00:01:15,827 --> 00:01:20,380
When that happens,
make for the elevator bay.

27
00:01:22,466 --> 00:01:25,218
Copy.

28
00:01:41,018 --> 00:01:42,718
Now, remember
what I told you--

29
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,175
timing
is everything.

30
00:01:56,568 --> 00:01:59,068
Maintain a pace
of 1.3 meters

31
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:01,421
per second.
Six seconds to target.

32
00:02:01,423 --> 00:02:03,706
5, 4...

33
00:02:06,578 --> 00:02:09,762
Now is the time,
gentlemen.

34
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:17,103
It's a fingerprint reader.
I can't crack it.

35
00:02:17,105 --> 00:02:19,222
I can.

36
00:02:24,528 --> 00:02:29,032
You have 5.3 seconds to get
down the east stairwell.

37
00:02:29,034 --> 00:02:31,734
Stop. Stop!

38
00:02:31,736 --> 00:02:33,453
What the hell are we doing?

39
00:02:33,455 --> 00:02:35,121
We got what we came for.

40
00:02:35,123 --> 00:02:37,207
He said to wait.

41
00:02:37,209 --> 00:02:40,076
Out in the open?
Forget this.

42
00:02:44,381 --> 00:02:46,549
Don't do it.
Don't do it!

43
00:02:46,551 --> 00:02:48,835
Ahh!

44
00:02:48,837 --> 00:02:52,055
Security clocked us!
Ughh!

45
00:02:52,057 --> 00:02:55,124
SCPD? You've got to send
some officers here.

46
00:02:55,126 --> 00:02:58,595
Up there, third floor.
Third floor!

47
00:02:58,597 --> 00:03:00,430
Ta ta ta ta!

48
00:03:04,386 --> 00:03:06,853
They've alerted
the SCPD.

49
00:03:06,855 --> 00:03:10,073
Exit the east lobby
in 22 seconds.

50
00:03:14,913 --> 00:03:17,113
SCPD!
Put your weapons down!

51
00:03:19,618 --> 00:03:21,317
Walczak!

52
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:24,454
Delta Charlie 52 to search,
I need back-up, downtown!

53
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:47,143
Power to the people.

54
00:03:48,626 --> 00:03:52,626

57
00:04:07,549 --> 00:04:08,915
Sara, I'm so sorry.

58
00:04:08,917 --> 00:04:11,033
It's ok, I'm fine.

59
00:04:11,035 --> 00:04:13,970
Let me see.
Let me see.

60
00:04:16,373 --> 00:04:19,475
She's bleeding,
but it's not deep.

61
00:04:19,477 --> 00:04:22,595
Good, I can't take
any more scars.

62
00:04:22,597 --> 00:04:25,181
Speaking of...
Mortar round?

63
00:04:25,183 --> 00:04:27,016
Yeah, IED, the Paktika province
in Afghanistan.

64
00:04:27,018 --> 00:04:28,217
Good eye.

65
00:04:28,219 --> 00:04:29,752
I know my wounds.

66
00:04:29,754 --> 00:04:31,104
Grenade. Algiers.

67
00:04:31,106 --> 00:04:32,905
I've never
been hit by a grenade.

68
00:04:32,907 --> 00:04:34,407
All those scars, you've never been
hit by a grenade?

69
00:04:34,409 --> 00:04:36,109
Arrow, knife, knife.

70
00:04:36,111 --> 00:04:37,276
A lot of bullets,
no grenades.

71
00:04:37,278 --> 00:04:38,728
I've got myself
a new bullet.

72
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:40,363
Nine millimeter,
right there.

73
00:04:40,365 --> 00:04:42,732
.38. I'm mostly swords,
and a spear.

74
00:04:42,734 --> 00:04:44,867
I have a scar.

75
00:04:44,869 --> 00:04:46,786
It's in my mouth.

76
00:04:46,788 --> 00:04:48,788
I had my wisdom teeth
removed when I was 16.

77
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:52,709
Three stitches.
They were really badly impacted.

78
00:04:52,711 --> 00:04:54,377
You're still cute.

79
00:04:54,379 --> 00:04:56,462
We should get going.
You don't want to be late

80
00:04:56,464 --> 00:04:58,514
for your own
welcome home party.

81
00:04:58,516 --> 00:05:01,134
You didn't have
to throw me a party, Ollie.

82
00:05:01,136 --> 00:05:02,935
Sara, when you come back
from the dead, you get a party.

83
00:05:02,937 --> 00:05:04,470
It's a Queen family tradition.

84
00:05:04,472 --> 00:05:06,139
I don't know how well
that's going to work

85
00:05:06,141 --> 00:05:07,523
with the Lance family
tradition

86
00:05:07,525 --> 00:05:08,975
of holding grudges
forever.

87
00:05:08,977 --> 00:05:11,477
She'll come around.
Maybe.

88
00:05:11,479 --> 00:05:12,928
And maybe we should
keep what's going on

89
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:14,397
between you and me

90
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:16,699
between us.
For Laurel's sake.

91
00:05:16,701 --> 00:05:19,101
I get that.

92
00:05:19,103 --> 00:05:20,370
I survived Lian Yu
and Nanda Parbat,

93
00:05:20,372 --> 00:05:22,438
I guess I can handle
a cocktail party.

94
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,440
Don't be so sure.

95
00:05:31,048 --> 00:05:33,499
We're never
going to make it.

96
00:05:33,501 --> 00:05:37,754
Ivo has eight guards
on deck at all times, all armed.

97
00:05:37,756 --> 00:05:39,756
The second they see us,
we're dead.

98
00:05:39,758 --> 00:05:42,208
Assuming we can deal
with Ivo's defenses.

99
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:44,177
How are we going to get
close enough to board the ship?

100
00:05:44,179 --> 00:05:45,728
Maybe we build
a raft.

101
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:47,630
It'll take us weeks
to find the timber.

102
00:05:47,632 --> 00:05:49,015
We don't have weeks.

103
00:05:49,017 --> 00:05:50,733
I've been on this island
for 264 days.

104
00:05:50,735 --> 00:05:53,352
All I have is weeks.
Shut up.

105
00:05:53,354 --> 00:05:54,737
You don't have
to stick up for me, Ollie.

106
00:05:54,739 --> 00:05:56,939
What? No, both
of you shut up.

107
00:05:56,941 --> 00:05:58,741
Listen.

108
00:05:58,743 --> 00:06:00,493
Do you hear that?

109
00:06:05,417 --> 00:06:07,583
Hey!
Hey!

110
00:06:07,585 --> 00:06:10,086
Hey!

111
00:06:10,088 --> 00:06:12,121
- Hey, down here!
- Help!

112
00:06:18,429 --> 00:06:21,931
You left us sitting in front
of the security camera.

113
00:06:21,933 --> 00:06:24,834
Guards could
have killed us.

114
00:06:24,836 --> 00:06:27,637
Are you listening?

115
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:31,441
If you had simply waited
for five more seconds, like you were told,

116
00:06:31,443 --> 00:06:33,276
no one would have died.

117
00:06:33,278 --> 00:06:36,946
Sorry. I wasn't going to bet
ten to twenty up in Iron Heights

118
00:06:36,948 --> 00:06:38,815
on your skills
with a stopwatch.

119
00:06:38,817 --> 00:06:40,900
"The strongest of all warriors

120
00:06:40,902 --> 00:06:42,985
are these two--
time and patience."

121
00:06:42,987 --> 00:06:44,520
What?

122
00:06:44,522 --> 00:06:46,989
It's from "War and Peace."

123
00:06:46,991 --> 00:06:48,825
1,440 pages.

124
00:06:48,827 --> 00:06:50,693
It takes a while,
but it's worth a read.

125
00:06:50,695 --> 00:06:54,964
Tolstoy knew that patience
was the epitome of strength.

126
00:06:54,966 --> 00:06:58,584
It takes fortitude
to stand still.

127
00:06:58,586 --> 00:07:00,837
Just as it is a sign
of weakness or cowardice

128
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:03,372
to move when you should not!

129
00:07:03,374 --> 00:07:05,040
Look.

130
00:07:05,042 --> 00:07:07,477
We did the job.
You owe me.

131
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:16,719
The dead are owed nothing.

132
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:41,243
Ah, come in.
Come in, come in.

133
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:45,748
Welcome home, Sara.

134
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:53,272
I'm so happy you're here.
Come on.

135
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,979
Oh, Sara, this is Sin.

136
00:07:59,981 --> 00:08:01,647
Wait, do you two
know each other?

137
00:08:01,649 --> 00:08:03,071
Uh, no.
We don't.

138
00:08:03,796 --> 00:08:05,364
Right. Uh...

139
00:08:05,389 --> 00:08:07,446
I love when people
come back from the dead.

140
00:08:07,471 --> 00:08:08,939
You know.

141
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:10,489
Juices my zombie fetish.

142
00:08:10,491 --> 00:08:12,608
- Hmm.
- Ahh.

143
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:13,776
Um, Roy.

144
00:08:13,778 --> 00:08:15,244
Sara.

145
00:08:15,246 --> 00:08:16,879
Come on.

146
00:08:16,881 --> 00:08:19,081
Sorry.

147
00:08:23,254 --> 00:08:26,889
Laurel, it's Ollie.
I hope you're coming to the party.

148
00:08:26,891 --> 00:08:29,592
I heard that you maybe were
a little mad at Sara,

149
00:08:29,594 --> 00:08:34,730
and I...she's your sister,
and--and you only get one.

150
00:08:34,732 --> 00:08:36,482
You know?

151
00:08:36,484 --> 00:08:37,733
Bye.

152
00:08:37,735 --> 00:08:39,602
Hey.

153
00:08:39,604 --> 00:08:41,587
Laurel
is not coming.

154
00:08:41,589 --> 00:08:43,155
Well, maybe
she just needs time.

155
00:08:43,157 --> 00:08:44,957
Yeah.

156
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:47,927
Yeah, I needed
time, too.

157
00:08:47,929 --> 00:08:50,062
When you got back, I...

158
00:08:50,064 --> 00:08:52,198
Well, I was pretty
harsh on you.

159
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,401
Hey, Mr. Lance,
you--you don't have to--

160
00:08:55,403 --> 00:08:57,353
Oh, I do.

161
00:08:57,355 --> 00:08:59,455
When you and Sara
went off on your dad's boat,

162
00:08:59,457 --> 00:09:01,374
you were just a kid,
both of you were.

163
00:09:01,376 --> 00:09:05,928
And whether
she came back, or...

164
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:09,482
I was out of line.

165
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:13,019
You're not
a killer, Oliver.

166
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:25,481
Yeah, come on, yeah.

167
00:09:27,652 --> 00:09:30,185
I'm so happy for you, Dinah.

168
00:09:30,187 --> 00:09:33,072
Those five years
that Oliver was gone,

169
00:09:33,074 --> 00:09:36,659
was...like a piece of me
was missing.

170
00:09:36,661 --> 00:09:38,294
I know just
what you mean.

171
00:09:38,296 --> 00:09:39,962
Oh, excuse me.

172
00:09:39,964 --> 00:09:42,632
Of course.

173
00:09:42,634 --> 00:09:46,201
I didn't think you'd be here.

174
00:09:46,203 --> 00:09:48,671
This is my house.

175
00:09:48,673 --> 00:09:51,841
And if you don't want to pretend
to be mother and son,

176
00:09:51,843 --> 00:09:55,144
then don't throw
parties in my home.

177
00:09:55,146 --> 00:09:58,097
Mom?

178
00:09:58,099 --> 00:10:00,349
Is everything ok
with you and Ollie?

179
00:10:00,351 --> 00:10:03,235
Yes, of course.

180
00:10:06,389 --> 00:10:08,324
Hey.

181
00:10:08,326 --> 00:10:10,359
Hey.

182
00:10:10,361 --> 00:10:15,281
You know, I still can't
quite believe it.

183
00:10:15,283 --> 00:10:18,233
I never really
thought Sara

184
00:10:18,235 --> 00:10:20,419
would come back
to us, Quentin.

185
00:10:23,924 --> 00:10:26,575
Yeah, I know.

186
00:10:29,413 --> 00:10:33,516
Excuse me. Lance.

187
00:10:33,518 --> 00:10:38,187
I'll be right there.

188
00:10:38,189 --> 00:10:40,022
It's work.

189
00:10:40,024 --> 00:10:42,308
There's a homicide
in the Glades, and I--

190
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:45,260
I better go.
Mm-hmm.

191
00:10:54,956 --> 00:10:56,438
I'm on my way.

192
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,491
How did
you know I was calling?

193
00:10:58,493 --> 00:11:00,743
Because Detective Lance
just got the same call.

194
00:11:06,834 --> 00:11:09,618
What, you guys just
show up to every crime scene now?

195
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:11,120
I saw you leave.

196
00:11:12,923 --> 00:11:16,342
CSU just pulled this out of a skel
I know named Eddie Walczak.

197
00:11:16,344 --> 00:11:18,511
I've never seen
a knife life this.

198
00:11:18,513 --> 00:11:21,063
It's not a knife,
it's a minute hand.

199
00:11:21,065 --> 00:11:23,733
Like from a clock.

200
00:11:23,735 --> 00:11:26,936
I popped Walczak for b&e
a few years back.

201
00:11:26,938 --> 00:11:28,738
This morning, he and an
accomplice were involved

202
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:30,539
in a robbery homicide.

203
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:32,074
What'd they steal?

204
00:11:32,076 --> 00:11:33,359
Some high-tech gizmo.

205
00:11:33,361 --> 00:11:36,579
Kord rep called it
a, um, skeleton key.

206
00:11:36,581 --> 00:11:38,364
What? You know what it is?

207
00:11:38,366 --> 00:11:41,150
It was intended as a military tool
to aid in code breaking

208
00:11:41,152 --> 00:11:42,818
on foreign
intelligence targets.

209
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:44,737
Felicity Smoak works
at Queen Consolidated

210
00:11:44,739 --> 00:11:47,706
and she said they were working on
something similar...

211
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:49,408
But Oliver Queen
shut it down once he realized

212
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:52,261
what it could be used for.
What?

213
00:11:52,263 --> 00:11:54,213
It could be modified
to open a bank vault.

214
00:11:54,215 --> 00:11:56,799
Any bank vault.
Ok, listen--

215
00:11:56,801 --> 00:11:58,717
Walczak's small-time
on a good day.

216
00:11:58,719 --> 00:12:00,719
I mean, I doubt he'd even know how
to use this thing,

217
00:12:00,721 --> 00:12:03,606
let alone break into
a place like Kord and steal it on his own.

218
00:12:03,608 --> 00:12:05,608
Walczak was
just the muscle.

219
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:08,811
We need to find
the brain.

220
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:27,038
Plant your feet.

221
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:30,175
Strong foundation.

222
00:12:30,177 --> 00:12:32,060
Equals stronger punch.

223
00:12:35,314 --> 00:12:37,099
Nice.

224
00:12:37,101 --> 00:12:39,434
If this is for self defense,
I'd recommend Wing Chun.

225
00:12:39,436 --> 00:12:41,052
It uses your opponent's
strength against him.

226
00:12:41,054 --> 00:12:43,905
So it's ideal
for smaller people...

227
00:12:43,907 --> 00:12:45,490
Like us.

228
00:12:45,492 --> 00:12:48,076
You seem like you can
take care of yourself just fine.

229
00:12:48,078 --> 00:12:50,495
Are you ok?

230
00:12:50,497 --> 00:12:53,532
Where are we
with the skeleton key?

231
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:57,252
And what...
are you wearing?

232
00:12:57,254 --> 00:12:59,621
I just thought I'd...

233
00:12:59,623 --> 00:13:02,007
I'm cross referencing
Walczak's known associates

234
00:13:02,009 --> 00:13:03,842
with decryption experts
on the NSA watch list,

235
00:13:03,844 --> 00:13:05,260
but it's taking some time.

236
00:13:05,262 --> 00:13:06,545
Which we don't have.

237
00:13:06,547 --> 00:13:08,246
Ok, the key is not
just a code breaker.

238
00:13:08,248 --> 00:13:10,265
In the wrong hands,
it's a weapon.

239
00:13:10,267 --> 00:13:11,317
Whoever killed Walczak,

240
00:13:11,342 --> 00:13:13,740
in addition to finding
creepy uses for clock parts,

241
00:13:14,138 --> 00:13:16,087
is very good
at covering his tracks.

242
00:13:16,089 --> 00:13:17,806
Lucky for us.
Uncovering tracks

243
00:13:17,808 --> 00:13:19,858
is what
you're very good at.

244
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:22,594
Right.

245
00:13:37,943 --> 00:13:40,962
Of course.

246
00:13:43,115 --> 00:13:45,634
Ohh!

247
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:49,471
He's barely alive.

248
00:13:49,473 --> 00:13:51,840
Do you have medical supplies
at the fuselage?

249
00:13:51,842 --> 00:13:54,226
We have--we have some.
Just go.

250
00:13:54,228 --> 00:13:56,061
I'll be fine.

251
00:13:59,765 --> 00:14:01,850
Hey.

252
00:14:01,852 --> 00:14:05,153
I'm really starting
to regret giving you a key.

253
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:08,657
I'm sorry I bailed
on the party.

254
00:14:08,659 --> 00:14:10,742
Ah, I figured you wouldn't
make an appearance.

255
00:14:10,744 --> 00:14:13,778
Finally, someone understands.

256
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:15,697
Well, I, uh,
I wouldn't go that far.

257
00:14:15,699 --> 00:14:18,033
But I understand how
Sara keeping it a secret

258
00:14:18,035 --> 00:14:20,252
that she was
still alive could hurt.

259
00:14:20,254 --> 00:14:21,870
'Cause it hurt me, too.

260
00:14:21,872 --> 00:14:24,656
I sense a "but"
coming in my future.

261
00:14:24,658 --> 00:14:27,792
But, yes, but I need you
to move past it.

262
00:14:27,794 --> 00:14:30,846
Laurel.

263
00:14:30,848 --> 00:14:32,330
A family dinner.

264
00:14:32,332 --> 00:14:35,400
It's a chance to reconcile.

265
00:14:35,402 --> 00:14:37,469
I don't want
to reconcile with Sara.

266
00:14:37,471 --> 00:14:39,588
I'm not talking
about you and Sara.

267
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:41,973
I'm talking about...

268
00:14:41,975 --> 00:14:43,508
me and your mom.

269
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:46,261
What do you mean?

270
00:14:46,263 --> 00:14:47,612
I don't know to
describe it.

271
00:14:47,614 --> 00:14:51,116
It was like there
was, um...signals.

272
00:14:51,118 --> 00:14:53,869
And feelings.

273
00:14:53,871 --> 00:14:55,787
And I'm not exactly sure
what's going on,

274
00:14:55,789 --> 00:14:57,539
but I figured if we were all
together as a family,

275
00:14:57,541 --> 00:15:00,625
maybe it would remind her of
how happy we were.

276
00:15:00,627 --> 00:15:02,627
You know?

277
00:15:02,629 --> 00:15:04,346
I mean, I don't
know, maybe it...

278
00:15:04,348 --> 00:15:05,997
Is it stupid?

279
00:15:05,999 --> 00:15:08,866
No, it--

280
00:15:10,337 --> 00:15:11,836
Go for Delta-Charlie 52.

281
00:15:11,838 --> 00:15:13,255
415 in progress.

282
00:15:13,257 --> 00:15:15,340
Widmeer Bank. Lieutenant
requesting all units.

283
00:15:15,342 --> 00:15:17,559
Delta-Charlie 52
responding.

284
00:15:17,561 --> 00:15:20,044
I got to go.

285
00:15:21,564 --> 00:15:24,048
Tonight.

286
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:25,183
8:30.

287
00:15:25,185 --> 00:15:28,103
Tell everyone to be here.
What?

288
00:15:28,105 --> 00:15:30,572
Well, your place
is too small,

289
00:15:30,574 --> 00:15:33,108
and, no offense,
it's kind of a mess, so...

290
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:36,161
Oh, sweetheart.
Ok.

291
00:15:36,163 --> 00:15:37,829
I love you, sweetheart.

292
00:15:37,831 --> 00:15:39,998
Ok.

293
00:15:42,286 --> 00:15:45,403
Device is hot.
3.2 seconds.

294
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:51,710
Extract as much money
as you can in 90 seconds.

295
00:15:58,517 --> 00:16:00,385
Stop! Get out of there!

296
00:16:00,387 --> 00:16:01,553
We've still got 20 seconds.

297
00:16:01,555 --> 00:16:03,555
No, you don't.

298
00:16:03,557 --> 00:16:05,440
Come on!

299
00:16:08,311 --> 00:16:10,195
They're
already gone!

300
00:16:10,197 --> 00:16:12,096
I think
I have an idea where.

301
00:16:12,098 --> 00:16:13,898
The skeleton key operates
on an OFDM wireless signal.

302
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,233
I'm picking up
a transmission signal

303
00:16:15,235 --> 00:16:16,601
in the alley next
to the bank.

304
00:16:16,603 --> 00:16:18,954
But you won't be
heading there.

305
00:16:18,956 --> 00:16:20,538
What was that?

306
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:22,824
He's hacked our
transmission.

307
00:16:22,826 --> 00:16:26,244
My associates may be
headed to the alley,

308
00:16:26,246 --> 00:16:28,830
but the 9:10 bus
from Crescent Circle

309
00:16:28,832 --> 00:16:32,550
is about to collide with
the Starlight Freight Express.

310
00:16:35,838 --> 00:16:38,473
Oh, my God, he's right, the 9:10's
headed for the track at Amherst.

311
00:16:38,475 --> 00:16:41,593
By my calculations,
you can't be in two places at once.

312
00:16:41,595 --> 00:16:43,795
He doesn't know
there's two of us.

313
00:16:53,239 --> 00:16:56,107
Come on!
Come on!

314
00:17:05,868 --> 00:17:07,769
He's in the transit
department network!

315
00:17:07,771 --> 00:17:09,871
He's--he's hacked
the signaling system.

316
00:17:09,873 --> 00:17:12,707
I--I can't get
the crossing barriers down!

317
00:17:12,709 --> 00:17:14,325
Those
buses have radios.

318
00:17:14,327 --> 00:17:15,827
Can you break in,
wave them off?

319
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:18,129
No, he's keeping me out.

320
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:58,651
I guess it's not real until
the media comes up with a nickname.

321
00:17:58,653 --> 00:18:00,870
How can I run a bar
without any bartenders?

322
00:18:00,872 --> 00:18:02,505
For that matter,
how can you quit

323
00:18:02,507 --> 00:18:03,957
without giving me notice?

324
00:18:03,959 --> 00:18:07,661
No, one hour before opening
is not notice, Mandy.

325
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:11,664
Can I talk to you
for a second?

326
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:15,668
I'm going to go use
the little blonde's room.

327
00:18:18,506 --> 00:18:20,523
Everything ok?

328
00:18:20,525 --> 00:18:21,941
You tell me.

329
00:18:21,943 --> 00:18:23,143
Other than the party,

330
00:18:23,145 --> 00:18:24,527
I haven't seen you
at home all week.

331
00:18:24,529 --> 00:18:26,196
I've been busy.

332
00:18:26,198 --> 00:18:28,648
Being a CEO doesn't leave me
a lot of free time.

333
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:31,601
Yeah, looks to me a whole lot like
you're avoiding mom.

334
00:18:31,603 --> 00:18:33,453
I'm not avoiding mom.

335
00:18:33,455 --> 00:18:35,872
You're lucky your life
does not revolve around lying.

336
00:18:35,874 --> 00:18:37,324
Thea.

337
00:18:37,326 --> 00:18:39,709
Everything's fine.

338
00:18:39,711 --> 00:18:42,796
You know, it's secrets that pushed
this family apart in the first place, Ollie.

339
00:18:42,798 --> 00:18:44,998
Speedy, speedy. Really.

340
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,001
Everything's fine.

341
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,595
What do we know?

342
00:18:58,597 --> 00:19:00,180
He hacked
into our frequency,

343
00:19:00,182 --> 00:19:02,015
somehow gained
remote access,

344
00:19:02,017 --> 00:19:04,401
but I upgraded
our firewall.

345
00:19:04,403 --> 00:19:06,936
Now he won't be able to talk into
our comms even if he had a bazooka.

346
00:19:06,938 --> 00:19:08,905
You know...
computer science-wise.

347
00:19:08,907 --> 00:19:10,774
Good.

348
00:19:10,776 --> 00:19:13,360
I think I have something
that might help us track him down.

349
00:19:13,362 --> 00:19:15,328
I can run that
to the lab.

350
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:17,563
I spent a year on the freighter
studying genetic blood anomalies.

351
00:19:17,565 --> 00:19:20,200
I kind of know my way
around a microscope.

352
00:19:20,202 --> 00:19:23,286
There's some significant
cell damage

353
00:19:23,288 --> 00:19:26,005
and the platelet count
is extremely low.

354
00:19:26,007 --> 00:19:28,074
Felicity, can I use
your computer?

355
00:19:32,213 --> 00:19:34,381
Macgregor's Syndrome.
It's a genetic defect

356
00:19:34,383 --> 00:19:36,516
that creates fluid
build-up in the lungs,

357
00:19:36,518 --> 00:19:40,687
which leads to oxygen deprivation
and multi system organ failure.

358
00:19:40,689 --> 00:19:42,222
It's terminal.

359
00:19:42,224 --> 00:19:44,090
But the syndrome may
give us a way to ID him.

360
00:19:44,092 --> 00:19:45,847
People with Macgregor's
are extremely rare,

361
00:19:45,848 --> 00:19:47,397
and people with Macgregor's
and a degree in computer

362
00:19:47,422 --> 00:19:48,801
science are even more rare.

363
00:19:49,364 --> 00:19:52,365
William Tockman.
Former encryption engineer at,

364
00:19:52,367 --> 00:19:54,567
wait for it--
Kord Enterprises.

365
00:19:54,569 --> 00:19:57,169
What's the point? He'll be dead before
he can spend all the money.

366
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:01,324
He's not stealing
the money for himself.

367
00:20:01,326 --> 00:20:04,210
He's using it for his
family. His sister, specifically.

368
00:20:04,212 --> 00:20:06,779
She's got cystic fibrosis and needs
a lung transplant.

369
00:20:06,781 --> 00:20:08,798
Give me an address, please.

370
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,917
52 Nelson Way.

371
00:20:19,844 --> 00:20:24,564
This area doesn't look
very residential.

372
00:20:24,566 --> 00:20:26,065
There.

373
00:20:26,067 --> 00:20:28,301
That's
Tockman's ride.

374
00:20:51,258 --> 00:20:55,211
Tockman's not here.
Just some device.

375
00:20:55,213 --> 00:20:57,380
I'm on it.
Whatever's in the truck

376
00:20:57,382 --> 00:20:59,332
is transmitting the same OFDM signal
Tockman used at the bank.

377
00:20:59,334 --> 00:21:01,885
Can you trace it?
As we speak.

378
00:21:01,887 --> 00:21:06,286
It's leading...
back to our network.

379
00:21:07,948 --> 00:21:09,985
Tockman's piggybacking
off my hack. It's a trap.

380
00:21:10,061 --> 00:21:12,345
He--he's trying
to break into our network.

381
00:21:12,347 --> 00:21:14,847
I'm not trying.

382
00:21:14,849 --> 00:21:16,699
I am.

383
00:21:17,785 --> 00:21:21,020
Where are you?

384
00:21:21,022 --> 00:21:23,756
Are you home?

385
00:21:25,442 --> 00:21:27,026
Are you safe?

386
00:21:27,028 --> 00:21:29,295
Somewhere you think
you're safe...

387
00:21:29,297 --> 00:21:32,549
Somewhere without windows
for anyone to creep through?

388
00:21:32,551 --> 00:21:35,168
Underground, perhaps?

389
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:39,472
You think no one
can get to you?

390
00:21:39,474 --> 00:21:42,308
You think no one
can touch you

391
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:45,211
in the safety
of your hidey hole?

392
00:21:45,213 --> 00:21:46,879
Felicity...

393
00:21:46,881 --> 00:21:49,015
But I can.

394
00:22:03,524 --> 00:22:04,726
How bad?

395
00:22:04,727 --> 00:22:07,160
Tockman used
the skeleton key

396
00:22:07,162 --> 00:22:08,662
to penetrate
our firewall.

397
00:22:08,664 --> 00:22:10,630
And recode
our security.

398
00:22:10,632 --> 00:22:13,066
Basically, he told our system
to commit suicide.

399
00:22:13,068 --> 00:22:15,135
And it did.

400
00:22:15,137 --> 00:22:16,703
Bravo, clock king.

401
00:22:16,705 --> 00:22:18,038
Sara stopped Tockman's men
before they could

402
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,806
get away with the cash.

403
00:22:19,808 --> 00:22:23,610
So Tockman is going
to be looking for another score.

404
00:22:23,612 --> 00:22:27,380
Maybe we should
give him one.

405
00:22:27,382 --> 00:22:30,250
Would you call Walter
and have him liquidate

406
00:22:30,252 --> 00:22:32,185
500,000 shares of QC stock?

407
00:22:32,187 --> 00:22:34,955
Put it in cash in my vault
at Starling National,

408
00:22:34,957 --> 00:22:36,923
and ask him
to do it tonight.

409
00:22:36,925 --> 00:22:40,060
If Tockman wants
to make another score...

410
00:22:40,062 --> 00:22:43,730
Who better to rob than
a suddenly cash flush Oliver Queen?

411
00:22:43,732 --> 00:22:45,365
And what if he doesn't
take the bait?

412
00:22:45,367 --> 00:22:48,201
That's a good point.
Make it 800,000 shares.

413
00:22:48,203 --> 00:22:49,903
Ok.
What can I do?

414
00:22:49,905 --> 00:22:51,204
Go to your dinner.

415
00:22:51,206 --> 00:22:53,073
Your family's probably
waiting for you.

416
00:22:53,075 --> 00:22:55,008
Right.

417
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:57,677
Dinner at Laurel's.

418
00:22:57,679 --> 00:22:59,712
This is more important.

419
00:22:59,714 --> 00:23:02,315
You can't do
anything here, Sara.

420
00:23:02,317 --> 00:23:04,651
Your family's
important, too.

421
00:23:04,653 --> 00:23:06,686
Yeah.
Hey.

422
00:23:08,289 --> 00:23:09,589
You should go.

423
00:23:09,591 --> 00:23:13,026
Will you go with me?

424
00:23:13,028 --> 00:23:14,794
What?

425
00:23:14,796 --> 00:23:17,163
I know I've wanted us
all to get together for a while now.

426
00:23:17,165 --> 00:23:19,432
It's just, now that it's
actually here, I'm nervous.

427
00:23:19,434 --> 00:23:22,969
I mean, last time I saw Laurel,
it...didn't go very well,

428
00:23:22,971 --> 00:23:24,737
and...

429
00:23:24,739 --> 00:23:27,240
It'd be helpful to not
have to go alone.

430
00:23:27,242 --> 00:23:30,410
I should probably
stay here.

431
00:23:30,412 --> 00:23:32,845
What is it exactly you think
you can do here to help?

432
00:23:35,649 --> 00:23:36,849
Call if you need us.

433
00:23:36,851 --> 00:23:39,018
Yep.

434
00:23:41,121 --> 00:23:43,656
You know, it's not
your fault, Felicity.

435
00:23:43,658 --> 00:23:45,791
Really?
Which one of the rest of you

436
00:23:45,793 --> 00:23:48,294
put up the security
safeguards?

437
00:23:48,296 --> 00:23:49,695
Maybe if it been Sara,

438
00:23:49,697 --> 00:23:53,766
we wouldn't be
in this mess.

439
00:23:53,768 --> 00:23:55,301
Now, I know we haven't
talked about this,

440
00:23:55,303 --> 00:23:57,303
but it must be difficult
for you seeing them together.

441
00:23:57,305 --> 00:23:59,338
This isn't about them
being together.

442
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:02,842
This is about me.
Ok, Sara can analyze blood.

443
00:24:02,844 --> 00:24:06,612
She can kick ass.
She can do anything.

444
00:24:06,614 --> 00:24:08,881
And the one thing
I'm supposed to be good at,

445
00:24:08,883 --> 00:24:10,850
I'm failing at
miserably.

446
00:24:10,852 --> 00:24:14,820
And why do you even
need me now that you have her?

447
00:24:14,822 --> 00:24:17,656
Because you're irreplaceable,
Felicity.

448
00:24:23,163 --> 00:24:26,332
I have a lot
of work to do.

449
00:24:37,177 --> 00:24:40,679
Laurel,
Sara's here.

450
00:24:48,855 --> 00:24:50,255
Oh.

451
00:24:50,257 --> 00:24:51,456
Hey, Mom.

452
00:24:51,458 --> 00:24:53,725
Hi.

453
00:24:53,727 --> 00:24:55,861
Oliver.
Well, thank you,

454
00:24:55,863 --> 00:24:57,362
these are lovely.

455
00:24:57,364 --> 00:24:59,598
Thank you.

456
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,967
Hey.

457
00:25:01,969 --> 00:25:04,169
I don't remember
your last name being Lance.

458
00:25:04,171 --> 00:25:06,905
Well, yeah, I certainly didn't want
to crash your family dinner,

459
00:25:06,907 --> 00:25:09,374
but then...Sara and I
ran into each other,

460
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:10,909
and she mentioned it.

461
00:25:10,911 --> 00:25:12,344
And I told him how dad

462
00:25:12,346 --> 00:25:14,446
was making his famous
chicken cacciatore.

463
00:25:14,448 --> 00:25:16,615
Actually--excuse me!

464
00:25:16,617 --> 00:25:19,084
We're, uh, we're--Oliver.

465
00:25:19,086 --> 00:25:20,886
Hey, Mr. Lance.

466
00:25:23,022 --> 00:25:26,057
Yeah. Um, we're having
pizza. I'm sorry.

467
00:25:26,059 --> 00:25:27,893
I had a little incident
in the kitchen.

468
00:25:27,895 --> 00:25:29,160
I guess that's what
happens when you haven't

469
00:25:29,162 --> 00:25:31,062
used an oven in six years.

470
00:25:31,064 --> 00:25:33,431
Want to grab a slice?

471
00:25:33,433 --> 00:25:35,600
Yeah, when I was
pitching a tower of caccitore--

472
00:25:35,602 --> 00:25:37,268
a cacciatore tower, yeah.

473
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:39,871
Are you still teaching,
Mrs. Lance?

474
00:25:39,873 --> 00:25:42,040
Yes, I am. Greek
and Medieval History

475
00:25:42,042 --> 00:25:44,609
at Central City University.
Wow.

476
00:25:44,611 --> 00:25:46,611
You could probably
give them notice.

477
00:25:46,613 --> 00:25:48,379
Why would I do that?

478
00:25:48,381 --> 00:25:50,415
Well, I mean, you're going to come
back to Starling, right?

479
00:25:50,417 --> 00:25:52,283
No.

480
00:25:52,285 --> 00:25:54,986
I'm not moving back
to starling, Quentin.

481
00:25:54,988 --> 00:25:56,421
Well, Sara's back.

482
00:25:56,423 --> 00:25:58,723
I have a new life
in Central City,

483
00:25:58,725 --> 00:26:01,326
and, um, I have
a wonderful job.

484
00:26:01,328 --> 00:26:03,194
Well, there's
jobs here.

485
00:26:06,532 --> 00:26:09,000
More than a job.

486
00:26:09,002 --> 00:26:11,502
Um...I have...

487
00:26:11,504 --> 00:26:14,272
Someone.

488
00:26:15,541 --> 00:26:17,041
Oh.

489
00:26:17,043 --> 00:26:18,743
Congratulations.

490
00:26:18,745 --> 00:26:20,945
You know,
it's great, Mom.

491
00:26:20,947 --> 00:26:23,481
You deserve
to be happy.

492
00:26:23,483 --> 00:26:26,017
- Everybody does.
- Yeah.

493
00:26:30,489 --> 00:26:32,390
Ohh.

494
00:26:32,392 --> 00:26:36,394
You've got to be
kidding me.

495
00:26:36,396 --> 00:26:38,529
What?

496
00:26:38,531 --> 00:26:41,899
You've been back
like, what, a week?

497
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:46,637
And you're not
even denying it.

498
00:26:46,639 --> 00:26:49,507
It's...It's
complicated.

499
00:26:49,509 --> 00:26:53,077
Of course
it is. It's you.

500
00:26:53,079 --> 00:26:54,545
Laurel, please.

501
00:26:54,547 --> 00:26:55,946
Dad, you are no better
than they are.

502
00:26:55,948 --> 00:26:57,982
I mean, what did you think,
mom was just going

503
00:26:57,984 --> 00:26:59,350
to sit around and wait
for you for six years

504
00:26:59,352 --> 00:27:00,651
to bake her chicken?
Ok, Laurel, enough!

505
00:27:00,653 --> 00:27:02,653
And sweep her
back off her feet?

506
00:27:02,655 --> 00:27:04,788
Enough, ok?
Yeah, you know what, it is enough!

507
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:07,858
Invite yourselves out
when you're done.

508
00:27:14,332 --> 00:27:16,500
My wallet.

509
00:27:16,502 --> 00:27:18,669
Ok.

510
00:27:27,946 --> 00:27:29,513
She's my daughter.

511
00:27:29,515 --> 00:27:31,882
She's 12.

512
00:27:31,884 --> 00:27:34,451
I need to talk to her.

513
00:27:34,453 --> 00:27:36,386
Your radio's broken.

514
00:27:40,225 --> 00:27:42,326
Her mother died.

515
00:27:42,328 --> 00:27:44,361
Just after she
got out of diapers.

516
00:27:44,363 --> 00:27:46,630
Cancer.

517
00:27:46,632 --> 00:27:48,398
And without me...

518
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:51,068
She's not going to have anybody
to look after her.

519
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:53,070
So...

520
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:59,409
I know I don't know you.

521
00:27:59,411 --> 00:28:02,212
And I know
you don't know me.

522
00:28:02,214 --> 00:28:05,515
But...

523
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:08,985
Please make sure
my daughter's ok.

524
00:28:08,987 --> 00:28:11,087
Please.

525
00:28:18,729 --> 00:28:20,764
Hey!

526
00:28:20,766 --> 00:28:22,432
You are
unbelievable!

527
00:28:22,434 --> 00:28:25,101
You lecture me on how
I need to repair

528
00:28:25,103 --> 00:28:26,870
my relationship
with Sara

529
00:28:26,872 --> 00:28:28,805
when you're the one
who messed it up in the first place.

530
00:28:28,807 --> 00:28:30,473
By screwing her!

531
00:28:30,475 --> 00:28:32,442
And now you're
doing it again.

532
00:28:32,444 --> 00:28:35,045
You're right.
This is all my fault.

533
00:28:35,047 --> 00:28:36,946
Yeah. Yeah,
yes, it is.

534
00:28:36,948 --> 00:28:39,149
And is you losing your job,

535
00:28:39,151 --> 00:28:41,584
doing drugs
and being a drunk,

536
00:28:41,586 --> 00:28:43,253
is that my fault?

537
00:28:43,255 --> 00:28:44,921
Is that your family's fault,

538
00:28:44,923 --> 00:28:47,157
or are you going
to blame Tommy for dying?

539
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:48,558
Screw you,
Oliver.

540
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,194
I have stood by you
through everything--

541
00:28:51,196 --> 00:28:53,129
the DUI, losing your job,

542
00:28:53,131 --> 00:28:54,964
and Laurel, I was concerned
about your well-being

543
00:28:54,966 --> 00:28:57,767
when you were trying to get
my mother the death penalty!

544
00:28:57,769 --> 00:29:00,103
Yeah, you've been a real
stand-up kind of guy.

545
00:29:00,105 --> 00:29:02,739
Laurel, do you think you're the only one
that is having a hard time?!

546
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:05,008
Do you think you're the only one
with family issues?

547
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:08,111
You have--
you have no idea

548
00:29:08,113 --> 00:29:10,713
what is going on
with my family right now.

549
00:29:12,850 --> 00:29:17,420
But I am still standing here.

550
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:21,891
And you are still blaming
everybody but yourself.

551
00:29:21,893 --> 00:29:24,460
Are you done?

552
00:29:27,664 --> 00:29:30,366
Yeah.

553
00:29:30,368 --> 00:29:34,070
Yeah, I'm done.

554
00:29:34,072 --> 00:29:38,074
I'm done taking the blame.

555
00:29:38,076 --> 00:29:41,544
And I'm done caring.

556
00:29:42,846 --> 00:29:46,248
Why don't you go have a drink?

557
00:29:48,418 --> 00:29:50,319
Get wasted, go...

558
00:29:50,321 --> 00:29:52,721
Go to Verdant.

559
00:29:52,723 --> 00:29:55,991
I'll pay for it.

560
00:30:00,063 --> 00:30:03,699
I have loved you
for half my life.

561
00:30:07,837 --> 00:30:10,205
But I'm done
running after you.

562
00:30:27,383 --> 00:30:28,435
Have you seen Felicity?

563
00:30:28,438 --> 00:30:30,627
No. Wait, why?

564
00:30:30,628 --> 00:30:32,694
I went to Big Belly to get some take-out.
When I came back, she was gone.

565
00:30:32,696 --> 00:30:34,696
I haven't seen her for hours.

566
00:30:38,368 --> 00:30:40,002
Hey.

567
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:42,205
Tockman took the bait.
The money you had Walter deposit.

568
00:30:42,206 --> 00:30:44,706
I'm reading his signal
at Starling National.

569
00:30:44,708 --> 00:30:47,876
Wait...How do you
know that?

570
00:30:47,878 --> 00:30:51,480
Because I'm here.
What?!

571
00:31:12,269 --> 00:31:14,403
Aahh!

572
00:31:14,405 --> 00:31:16,572
Ahem.

573
00:31:16,574 --> 00:31:19,542
What are you doing here?
I'm tracking Tockman.

574
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:21,610
He fried our computers,
so I'm using the bank's

575
00:31:21,612 --> 00:31:23,112
to trace the skeleton key's
signature.

576
00:31:23,114 --> 00:31:24,546
And the jacket?

577
00:31:24,548 --> 00:31:26,815
I was cold.
Hmm.

578
00:31:26,817 --> 00:31:28,851
Diggle, get her out of here.

579
00:31:31,288 --> 00:31:32,921
Tockman disabled
the bank's security system.

580
00:31:32,923 --> 00:31:35,424
I re-abled it.

581
00:31:37,327 --> 00:31:39,461
They're blocking
our way out.

582
00:31:39,463 --> 00:31:42,297
I'll deal with them.

583
00:31:43,766 --> 00:31:45,400
Tockman's
signal's strong.

584
00:31:45,402 --> 00:31:47,035
He's here, he's close.
Find him, Felicity.

585
00:31:47,037 --> 00:31:48,904
No need.

586
00:31:48,906 --> 00:31:50,873
I'll tell you
exactly where I am.

587
00:31:50,875 --> 00:31:53,809
I'm everywhere.
At the moment, I'm particularly focused

588
00:31:53,811 --> 00:31:55,477
on the sub-level.

589
00:31:55,479 --> 00:31:58,380
The gas mains,
specifically.

590
00:32:01,852 --> 00:32:03,285
Oh, my God. He shut down
the gas main release.

591
00:32:03,287 --> 00:32:04,786
And why is that bad?

592
00:32:04,788 --> 00:32:06,154
The build-up could
cause an explosion.

593
00:32:06,156 --> 00:32:07,889
It will. It'll blow up
three square blocks.

594
00:32:07,891 --> 00:32:09,458
No, it won't.

595
00:32:39,456 --> 00:32:42,123
Wait. Tockman
overplayed his hand.

596
00:32:42,125 --> 00:32:44,526
The gas main's in the city's network,
that's where I live.

597
00:32:44,528 --> 00:32:46,294
Am I supposed
to understand that?

598
00:32:46,296 --> 00:32:49,464
Ohh. In trying
to blow us up,

599
00:32:49,466 --> 00:32:51,065
he gave me a way
to track him down.

600
00:32:51,067 --> 00:32:53,101
That I understood.

601
00:33:15,624 --> 00:33:17,925
What's happening?

602
00:33:29,404 --> 00:33:32,139
Look out!

603
00:33:35,043 --> 00:33:37,545
You don't even know
why I'm doing this.

604
00:33:39,048 --> 00:33:41,716
The money's
not for me!

605
00:33:41,718 --> 00:33:43,417
I'm doing this
all for her!

606
00:33:43,419 --> 00:33:45,386
Doesn't make it right.

607
00:33:45,388 --> 00:33:48,389
Tempus fugit.
Time flies.

608
00:33:53,161 --> 00:33:54,962
What the hell was that?

609
00:33:54,964 --> 00:33:56,897
His cell phone.

610
00:33:56,899 --> 00:33:58,299
I uploaded
the same virus

611
00:33:58,301 --> 00:34:01,902
he used on my gear
in the foundry.

612
00:34:01,904 --> 00:34:04,471
I didn't just
kill him, did I?

613
00:34:04,473 --> 00:34:06,173
Just knocked him out.

614
00:34:11,313 --> 00:34:13,681
We did it.
You did it.

615
00:34:23,246 --> 00:34:25,848
Are you sure you don't want
to go to the hospital?

616
00:34:25,850 --> 00:34:29,151
Mm-mm. You guys never
go to the hospital.

617
00:34:29,153 --> 00:34:33,789
Besides, Dig gave me
some of those aspirins.

618
00:34:33,791 --> 00:34:35,224
Are you spinning?

619
00:34:35,226 --> 00:34:38,060
Aspirin?
Oxycodone.

620
00:34:38,062 --> 00:34:40,362
I wouldn't be here

621
00:34:40,364 --> 00:34:43,766
if you hadn't been
so brave. Thank you.

622
00:34:43,768 --> 00:34:45,734
It was nothing.

623
00:34:45,736 --> 00:34:48,203
I've always wanted to say
I've taken a bullet for someone,

624
00:34:48,205 --> 00:34:49,872
and now I can.

625
00:34:49,874 --> 00:34:52,274
So really I should
be thanking you.

626
00:34:52,276 --> 00:34:54,443
All done.

627
00:34:54,445 --> 00:34:56,011
Ohh.

628
00:34:56,013 --> 00:34:58,580
Not bad, but you're still
going to have a scar.

629
00:34:58,582 --> 00:35:01,049
My own scar.

630
00:35:01,051 --> 00:35:02,484
Yay.

631
00:35:06,122 --> 00:35:09,291
You all right?

632
00:35:09,293 --> 00:35:11,093
Diggle had mentioned
that maybe you were

633
00:35:11,095 --> 00:35:13,962
feeling...a little left out.

634
00:35:13,964 --> 00:35:16,999
What? No.

635
00:35:19,602 --> 00:35:21,637
I was just...

636
00:35:21,639 --> 00:35:23,839
use to being
your girl.

637
00:35:24,874 --> 00:35:28,009
I mean, not
your girl-girl.

638
00:35:28,011 --> 00:35:30,779
Your girl.

639
00:35:30,781 --> 00:35:33,315
I know it sounds
like the same word,

640
00:35:33,317 --> 00:35:37,452
but it means something
different in my head.

641
00:35:37,454 --> 00:35:39,387
Mmm.

642
00:35:39,389 --> 00:35:41,456
Hey.
Hmm?

643
00:35:41,458 --> 00:35:43,458
You will always
be my girl, Felicity.

644
00:35:50,233 --> 00:35:53,335
Can I have another
one of those aspirins?

645
00:35:58,607 --> 00:36:00,675
Hi.

646
00:36:00,677 --> 00:36:03,011
Try this.

647
00:36:09,185 --> 00:36:11,719
Good, huh?

648
00:36:11,721 --> 00:36:13,955
It's really good.

649
00:36:13,957 --> 00:36:15,190
Mm-hmm.

650
00:36:15,192 --> 00:36:16,991
And what
are you doing

651
00:36:16,993 --> 00:36:19,727
back here
mixing drinks?

652
00:36:19,729 --> 00:36:22,030
Thea hired me.

653
00:36:22,032 --> 00:36:24,966
I am the new bartender.

654
00:36:24,968 --> 00:36:26,834
Uh-huh.

655
00:36:26,836 --> 00:36:29,237
I bartended in college,
and, uh, well,

656
00:36:29,239 --> 00:36:31,472
it's kind of hard to get a job

657
00:36:31,474 --> 00:36:34,709
when international assassin
is the highlight of your résumé.

658
00:36:34,711 --> 00:36:36,744
You're going
to do great.

659
00:36:41,683 --> 00:36:43,851
I have to go home.

660
00:36:43,853 --> 00:36:45,019
Is everything ok?

661
00:36:45,021 --> 00:36:46,888
I hope so.

662
00:36:57,065 --> 00:37:00,001
You can go.

663
00:37:00,003 --> 00:37:03,170
I'm not here
to kill her or anything.

664
00:37:13,415 --> 00:37:16,183
I remember you used
to bartend

665
00:37:16,185 --> 00:37:20,020
at that skeevy bar
with the...

666
00:37:20,022 --> 00:37:23,924
peanut shells
all over the floor.

667
00:37:23,926 --> 00:37:25,593
Yeah, Oblivion.

668
00:37:25,595 --> 00:37:27,828
Right.

669
00:37:27,830 --> 00:37:31,699
I'm not here
for a drink or anything.

670
00:37:31,701 --> 00:37:35,402
Then why
are you here?

671
00:37:35,404 --> 00:37:38,839
Because I realized that...

672
00:37:38,841 --> 00:37:43,243
that I went on that boat
with you, too.

673
00:37:43,245 --> 00:37:45,312
And...

674
00:37:45,314 --> 00:37:48,315
I've been slowly

675
00:37:48,317 --> 00:37:51,452
drowning for all of these years.

676
00:37:54,489 --> 00:37:58,225
And after every heartbreak

677
00:37:58,227 --> 00:38:01,128
or set-back

678
00:38:01,130 --> 00:38:04,031
or loss...

679
00:38:04,033 --> 00:38:07,267
I sank deeper
into the dark water.

680
00:38:08,736 --> 00:38:12,673
And so when I saw you,

681
00:38:12,675 --> 00:38:15,008
so beautiful,

682
00:38:15,010 --> 00:38:17,644
and so alive,

683
00:38:17,646 --> 00:38:21,415
I realized that
I'm not those things.

684
00:38:21,417 --> 00:38:24,317
Not anymore.

685
00:38:27,755 --> 00:38:32,459
So please...

686
00:38:32,461 --> 00:38:35,195
Please don't hate me, Sara.

687
00:38:37,331 --> 00:38:39,032
Please.

688
00:38:47,675 --> 00:38:50,343
I missed you.

689
00:39:01,288 --> 00:39:04,090
Didn't think anything could
make you cry.

690
00:39:04,092 --> 00:39:07,627
Guess I'm not
as tough as you thought.

691
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:15,668
So...

692
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:18,504
Why the running
mascara?

693
00:39:18,506 --> 00:39:20,540
I had--

694
00:39:20,542 --> 00:39:23,543
I just had a moment
with my sister.

695
00:39:23,545 --> 00:39:26,012
It was a good one.

696
00:39:27,548 --> 00:39:29,349
That's good.

697
00:39:29,351 --> 00:39:31,784
Hey, Laurel's my big sister.

698
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:33,886
I still have room
for a little one.

699
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:36,122
Good.

700
00:39:36,124 --> 00:39:39,725
I don't know what
I'd do without you.

701
00:39:41,962 --> 00:39:44,197
Well, you won't have
to find out.

702
00:39:45,566 --> 00:39:48,367
I'm going
to go find Roy.

703
00:40:06,586 --> 00:40:09,355
Got it.

704
00:40:09,357 --> 00:40:12,091
It's too late.

705
00:40:12,093 --> 00:40:14,226
He's gone.

706
00:40:15,162 --> 00:40:18,430
We're all going
to die here.

707
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:20,966
Just like him.

708
00:40:22,636 --> 00:40:25,604
No, we're not.

709
00:40:30,210 --> 00:40:33,445
I think I found our way
on to the freighter.

710
00:40:35,415 --> 00:40:37,249
Parachute.

711
00:41:04,444 --> 00:41:05,577
Thea!

712
00:41:05,579 --> 00:41:08,613
Oliver.
What's wrong?

713
00:41:08,615 --> 00:41:10,549
Is everything
all right?

714
00:41:10,551 --> 00:41:12,851
Thea texted me there was
an emergency at the house.

715
00:41:12,853 --> 00:41:14,986
No emergency.
I'm in the middle of a meeting

716
00:41:14,988 --> 00:41:16,154
and Thea's
not even here.

717
00:41:16,156 --> 00:41:18,256
Well, then why would she...

718
00:41:19,759 --> 00:41:22,360
I can't believe she would do this.
Do what?

719
00:41:22,362 --> 00:41:25,230
She's trying to force us to talk because
she's sensing the tension between us.

720
00:41:25,232 --> 00:41:26,832
And what did you
tell her?

721
00:41:26,834 --> 00:41:28,700
Nothing.

722
00:41:28,702 --> 00:41:31,703
To protect her.

723
00:41:31,705 --> 00:41:33,405
Not you.

724
00:41:33,407 --> 00:41:36,841
Mrs. Queen.
Is everything ok?

725
00:41:36,843 --> 00:41:38,176
Yes, thank you.

726
00:41:38,178 --> 00:41:42,113
Uh, my son just
dropped by.

727
00:41:42,115 --> 00:41:45,984
Oliver, I'd like you
to meet Slade Wilson.

728
00:41:52,691 --> 00:41:56,027
It's a pleasure
to meet you...

729
00:41:56,029 --> 00:41:58,062
Mr. Queen.
